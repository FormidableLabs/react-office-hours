  - Yesterday I went flying!
- Why React?
  - Declarative UI
  - Just a view on your data
  - Optimized rendering
  - Hot reloading
- Open Data
  - Seattle Open Data: https://data.seattle.gov/
  - Search: https://data.seattle.gov/browse?q=bicycle
  - Fremont bicycle count: https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-SB-bicycle-count/aggm-esc4
  - There's the data. Now what? Download?
- Socrata APIs!
  - https://dev.socrata.com/data/
  - Search: http://www.opendatanetwork.com/search?q=seattle+bicycle
  - Found it: http://www.opendatanetwork.com/dataset/data.seattle.gov/65db-xm6k
  - Getting started: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.seattle.gov/4xy5-26gy
- Test the API
  - Postman (Chrome extension)
  - Example request: "https://data.seattle.gov/resource/4xy5-26gy.json?$order=date ASC&$where=date between '2015-01-27T21:18:15' and '2015-01-28T21:18:15'"
  - Postman will escape those spaces for you
- Get an App token
  - Not necessary for testing, but good for app development
